  "description": "This is our initial presentation on FAIR assessment in translational medicine projects given within the IMI FAIRplus Fellowship program. Specifically, we discussed our approaches for data FAIRification within the HeartMed ERAPerMed project as well as we asked for guidance and advice from the FAIRplus Fellowship mentors on some of the FAIR indicators and on how to proceed for their assessment.",
